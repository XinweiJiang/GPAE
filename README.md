Matlab Code for Gaussian Processes Autoencoder for Dimensionality Reduction


My code is based on old version of Neil Lawrence's GPLVM code(http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/N.Lawrence/fgplvm/) and C. K. I. Williams's multiple-class GP classification code(http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/homes/ckiw/code/gpclass.tar.gz) . For the consideration of compatibility, I have used and kept their codes in my project. Thanks.

Experimental Settings:

1.As this code is partly based on our prious work SLLGPLVM, please download the codes from https://github.com/XinweiJiang/SLLGPLVM;
2.Enter directory \SGPGPLVM;  
3.Run setdir.m to set paths; 
4.Run demo demAutoEncoderGPOil.m.


Notes:

In order to accelerate the speed, in this demo we reduced the number of iterations.
